# Ariel Spectroscopic Data and Databases Working Group

*Expert spectroscopic support for the ESA Ariel mission and the wider exoplanet community.*

> We coordinate the provision of spectroscopic data for the ESA Ariel mission, acting as an interface between the exoplanet modelling community and laboratory/theoretical spectroscopists.

## About the Working Group

The **Ariel Spectroscopic Data and Databases Working Group** (WG) brings together experts in molecular and atomic spectroscopy, laboratory astrophysics, and atmospheric modelling.  

Our goals are to:

- Identify and provide spectroscopic data needed for the **Ariel** space mission and related exoplanet atmosphere studies.
- Serve as an **expert contact point** for questions on data availability, quality, and coverage.
- Coordinate with data producers (laboratory and theoretical groups) and users (retrieval and modelling teams) to close gaps in available data.
- Maintain a transparent, community-visible workflow via GitHub.

This GitHub organisation, **[Ariel-data](https://github.com/Ariel-data)**, is the central hub for communication between **data providers** and **data users**.

## Spectroscopic Data We Support

We focus on data for **molecules and atoms relevant to exoplanet atmospheres**, particularly those targeted by Ariel and other current/future missions.

### Spectroscopic data products

- Molecular and atomic **line lists**
- **Opacities**
- Temperature- and pressure-dependent **cross sections**
- **Line broadening** parameters
- **Transition probabilities**
- **k-tables**
- **Oscillator strengths**

### Continuum and photoprocesses

- **Collision-induced absorption (CIA)**, including temperature and pressure dependence
- **Photodissociation cross sections**

### Particles and chemistry

- **Optical properties of particles** (aerosols, condensates, hazes)
- **Chemical reaction rate coefficients** and related atmospheric chemistry data

## How to Request Data or Ask Questions

We use **GitHub Issues** in category-specific repositories so that requests and discussions are:

- Traceable
- Publicly visible to the wider spectroscopic community
- Easy to follow up by WG members

### Step-by-step

1. Go to the [Ariel-data organisation](https://github.com/Ariel-data).
2. Choose the repository that best matches your request (see list below).
3. Click the **Issues** tab.
4. Click **New issue** and provide:
   - Target molecule(s) or atom(s)
   - Spectral range and resolution
   - Temperature and pressure range
   - Type of data (e.g. line list, CIA, broadening, photodissociation, aerosols, chemistry)
   - Intended application (e.g. forward model, retrievals, specific mission/instrument)
5. Submit the issue.  
   A WG member will pick it up, coordinate a response and, where needed, reach out to colleagues in the spectroscopic community.

  Overview of major spectroscopic databases, pointers to relevant entries for Ariel and exoplanet applications.

- **[aerosols](https://github.com/Ariel-data/aerosols)**  
  Optical properties (e.g. refractive indices, single-scattering properties) of particles, condensates, and hazes.

- **[linelists](https://github.com/Ariel-data/linelists)**  
  Molecular and atomic line lists, transition probabilities, oscillator strengths, and related spectroscopic data.

- **[atmochemistry](https://github.com/Ariel-data/atmochemistry)**

  Opacity tables, temperature- and pressure-dependent cross sections, k-tables, and related pre-computed products.

- **[HITRAN](https://github.com/Ariel-data/HITRAN)**  
  Information and guidance on using HITRAN and related compilations in the context of Ariel and exoplanet studies.

- **[CIA](https://github.com/Ariel-data/CIA)**  
  Collision-induced absorption (CIA) data, including temperature and pressure dependent cross sections.

- **[UV-cross-sections](https://github.com/Ariel-data/UV-cross-sections)**  
  UV and photodissociation cross sections for molecules important in exoplanet atmospheres.

- **[General](https://github.com/Ariel-data/General)**  
  Cross-cutting information, coordination notes, general documentation, and topics that do not fit in a single category.

We encourage data users and providers to follow or watch the relevant repositories and to contribute via issues and pull requests.

## Connection to Ariel and the White Paper

This WG operates within the **ESA Ariel Consortium** to ensure that the mission’s spectroscopic data needs are met and documented.

Many of the assessments and links collected here are based on our recent white paper:

> **Data availability and requirements relevant for the Ariel space mission and other exoplanet atmosphere applications**  
> *RASTI* **3**, 636–690 (2024)  
> DOI: [10.1093/rasti/rzae039](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rasti/rzae039)

We aim to keep this GitHub space **up to date and complementary** to the white paper, reflecting new data, updates, and community input.
